## Testing

If you use Stripe as your product merchant we will automatically switch to Stripe's test mode.

> **Any other merchants will incur a fee charge even in test mode unless you use test credentials for your merchant!**

You can toggle testing on & off at any time using the `Status` bar to the top right:
